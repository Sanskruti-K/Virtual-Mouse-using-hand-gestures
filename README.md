# Virtual-Mouse-using-hand-gestures

This virtual mouse system is based on HCI (Human Computer Interaction) using computer vision and hand gestures. Gestures captured with a built-in camera or webcam and processed with colour segmentation & detection technique. The system will allow the user to navigate the computer cursor using their hand bearing colour caps or tapes and left click, right click, scrolling will be performed using different hand gestures. This system captures frames using a webcam & track the fingertip of hand with a color cap and processes the frames to make them track-able and after that recognizes different gestures made by users and perform the mouse function.

  Objectives:
 
*	The objective is to manage computers and other devices with gestures rather than pointing and clicking a mouse.
*	Remove the requirement of having physical
*	To make system more comfortable and convenient.

  Methodology:
*	This system implemented using Color detection and segmentation techniques (detecting color pixels of fingertips with color caps).
*	Systemâ€™s webcam is used for tracking hand gestures. 
*	Computer vision techniques are used for gesture recognition.
